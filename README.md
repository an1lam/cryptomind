This repo tracks my progress learning more about blockchain internals.

## Goals
- Build a basic cryptocurrency from scratch in Go. This currency should be mine-able using a
  proof-of-work algorithm analogous to Bitcoin's.
- Write 3 blog-length posts describing some interesting things you've learned about cryptocurrencies
  or blockchains.

# Background
- Adam Back's Hashcash


# Important Terms
- Double-Spending Problem
- Proof-of-work
- Timestamp Server
- Merkle Tree
- Binomial Random Walk
- Gambler's Ruin

# Thoughts
- Interesting that lowering the cost of transactions was an original goal of Bitcoin.
- You can get rough anonymity with Bitcoin by switching keys for every transaction.

# Questions
- How does proof-of-work difficulty increase?
- How do nodes "catch up" when they fall behind? Nodes will jump to the longest branch of
  transactions.
- How does the mining algorithm decide whether to add an incentive to a transaction?
- Where does the q~z~ equation come from?
